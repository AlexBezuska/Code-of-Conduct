### Diversity and Inclusiveness Statement

Bento Miso is a community that values, defends and builds equitable experiences and diversity. We are committed to not just including marginalized voices and bodies, but also to actively fighting racism, sexism, and oppression in all its forms.

We **welcome** and **advocate for** the presence and contributions of all people regardless of their ability, age, body size, culture, education, ethnic origin, gender expression, gender identity, immigration status, marital status, nationality, physical appearance, political affiliations, race, religion, sexual orientation, sexuality, or socioeconomic status.

Prejudice, oppression, and discrimination are detrimental to the health and growth of our community and the individuals who are a part of it. Supporting the visibility of our diverse lives enhances the experiences of all community members. We recognize and honor our differences and vigorously defend Bento Miso as a safe and equitable space.
