Bento Miso is a community that values and defends diversity and is committed to anti-racism and anti-oppression.
We **welcome** and **advocate for** the presence and contributions of all people regardless of their gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, culture, abilities, ethnic origin, marital status, nationality, race, religion, education, or socioeconomic status.

Prejudice, oppression, and discrimination are detrimental to the growth of a rich and vibrant game community. Bento Miso is filled with diverse participants, and supporting the visibility of such diversity enhances the experiences of all community members. As such, **we value inclusiveness** and vigorously defend Bento Miso as a safe space for all participants.

We insist that everyone who uses the space—member or guest—remains mindful of, and takes responsibility for, their speech and behavior. This includes:
- Always acting out of respect and concern for the free expression of others
- Actively listening to others and not dominating discussions
- Not making assumptions about identity, experiences, or preferred pronouns
- Not using words that are racist, sexist, homophobic, classist, cissexist or ableist
- Humbly accepting respectful correction (or correcting yourself!)

**We do not tolerate destructive, exclusionary, abusive, or silencing behavior**
The terms we use to describe our experience are always changing, and we are always learning. We are eager to maintain and defend the safety and inclusivity of this community, so:
